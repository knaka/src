prompt = "\nMake a git commit for the staged changes with an appropriate message. If nothing is staged, say that and do nothing. The commit message should follow the \"Conventional Commits\" format and use the following template. Do NOT add any \"Generated with Claude Code\" or \"Co-Authored-By: Claude\" footers.\n\n```\n<type>[optional scope]: <description>\n\n[optional body]\n```\n\nIMPORTANT: You must analyze ONLY the git diff output. Do not use any memory from the conversation. Treat each commit as if you're seeing these changes for the first time with no context about how or why they were made."
